<h2> Music Producing: <h2>
<p> I love to produce and make music. I started out using the software Garageband, and took a class in middle school on how to use Garageband. The class was called Music Lab. I loved this class, and wanted to expand my knowledge on music, so, I invested in a software called Ableton Live 9 Standard. This was a very complex software, and once I first started using it, I was utterly confused on the whole new display. Nobs and buttons were everywhere, and I was immediately overwhelmed. </p>

<p> After a long time of using the software and experimenting with it, I was officially an expert at it. I was now familiar with all the nobs and buttons that used to confuse me. I started making songs on the software, and each song I created was better than the last. So, I thought: where is a place where I can share these? So I signed up for a soundcloud account, and now, I am posting my tracks on there for everyone to hear.</p>
